# Repository Summary: worthies/matcher

## Overview

The **worthies/matcher** repository is a **high-performance rule matching engine** built in Go, designed for production-scale applications that require fast, efficient rule-based decision making. This system excels at matching complex queries against large rule sets with sub-millisecond response times.

## What This Repository Does

### Core Functionality
- **Rule Matching Engine**: Matches incoming queries against configurable rule sets using multiple match types
- **Multi-Dimensional Matching**: Supports complex rules with multiple dimensions (product, environment, region, etc.)
- **Pattern Matching**: Provides exact, prefix, suffix, and wildcard matching capabilities
- **Weighted Scoring**: Automatically calculates rule priorities with manual override support

### Key Use Cases
- **Configuration Management**: Route requests based on product, environment, and deployment parameters
- **Feature Flagging**: Dynamic feature enablement based on multiple criteria
- **A/B Testing**: Route users to different experiences based on complex rules
- **Content Routing**: Direct traffic based on user attributes, geographic location, etc.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Apply business rules based on contextual information

## Architecture & Design

### Forest Index Architecture
- **Multi-dimensional trees** organized by match types for O(log n) search complexity
- **Shared Node Optimization**: Rules with identical paths share nodes to minimize memory usage
- **Match Type Organization**: Direct access to relevant branches (Equal, Prefix, Suffix, Any) eliminates unnecessary traversal
- **Partial Query Support**: Search with fewer dimensions than rules contain via MatchTypeAny branches

### Performance Characteristics
```
✅ Response Time: 78µs average (ultra-fast)
✅ Throughput: 12,703 QPS sustained
✅ Memory Efficiency: 398MB for 50,000 rules with 20 dimensions
✅ Resource Requirements: 2-core optimized, <10% of 4GB memory limit
✅ Scalability: Linear scaling with predictable resource usage
```

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Performance & Scalability**
- **Forest Index Architecture**: Multi-dimensional tree structures for optimal search performance
- **Shared Node Optimization**: Memory-efficient storage with node sharing between similar rules
- **Multi-Level Caching**: L1/L2 cache system with configurable TTL
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe operations with RWMutex protection
- **Production Validated**: Tested with 50k rules, 20 dimensions on 2 cores within 4GB memory

### 🔧 **Flexible Rule System**
- **Dynamic Dimensions**: Add, remove, and reorder dimensions at runtime
- **Multiple Match Types**:
  - `MatchTypeEqual`: Exact string matching
  - `MatchTypePrefix`: String starts with pattern
  - `MatchTypeSuffix`: String ends with pattern
  - `MatchTypeAny`: Wildcard matching
- **Dimension Consistency**: Enforced rule structure validation when dimensions are configured
- **Weight Conflict Detection**: Prevents duplicate rule weights for deterministic behavior

### 🏢 **Enterprise-Ready**
- **Pluggable Persistence**: JSON, Database, or custom storage backends
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Kafka/messaging queue integration for distributed rule updates
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive statistics and health checks
- **Backward Compatibility**: ForestIndex wrapper maintains compatibility with existing code

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Add a rule using fluent API
rule := matcher.NewRule("production_rule").
    Product("ProductA", matcher.MatchTypeEqual, 10.0).
    Route("main", matcher.MatchTypeEqual, 5.0).
    Tool("laser", matcher.MatchTypeEqual, 8.0).
    Build()

engine.AddRule(rule)

// Query for best match
query := matcher.CreateQuery(map[string]string{
    "product": "ProductA",
    "route":   "main",
    "tool":    "laser",
})

result, err := engine.FindBestMatch(query)
